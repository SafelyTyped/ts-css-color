# CssColor Safe Type for TypeScript

## Introduction

This TypeScript library gives you a CssColor safe type, for when you are working with CSS color values.

## Quick Start

```
# run this from your Terminal
npm install @safelytyped/css-color
```

```typescript
// add this import to your Typescript code
import { CssColor } from "@safelytyped/css-color"
```

__VS Code users:__ once you've added a single import anywhere in your project, you'll then be able to auto-import anything else that this library exports.
